- Do **not** use CSS frameworks such as **Tailwind**, **Bootstrap**, or others.  
  Only **pure CSS** is allowed.

- Reuse existing classes before creating new ones.  
  - If a class already exists in the global stylesheet, use it.  
  - If it doesn’t exist, create a new reusable class and document it for future use.

- All colors must come from variables defined in `:root`.  

- Prefer global styles when they can be reused across modules.
- Only create local styles if they are specific to a single module or component.

- Do not use !important unless it is strictly necessary and justified.

- Maintain a clean and consistent class structure. Avoid duplication and unclear naming.
