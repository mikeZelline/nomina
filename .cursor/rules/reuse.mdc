- Cursor must **always identify and create components** for any element or functionality that can be reused.

- Reusable logic, layouts, or UI elements should be implemented as **shared or standalone components**, not duplicated in multiple modules.

- When creating new features, Cursor should:
  1. Check if a similar component already exists in the project.
  2. Reuse or extend the existing component instead of creating a new one.
  3. Only create a new component if no reusable version exists.

- All components should be designed to be **configurable and independent**, allowing reuse across different modules without modification.

- Avoid code duplication — any repeating structure, logic, or style should be refactored into a reusable component or service.
