- Each API endpoint implementation must have **exactly three logs**:

  1. **Log the endpoint URL**
     ```ts
     console.log("Calling:", url);
     ```

  2. **Log the data being sent**
     ```ts
     console.log("Payload:", body);
     ```

  3. **Log the response received**
     ```ts
     console.log("Server response:", response);
     ```

- Do **not** add extra `console.log` statements by default in components, services, or modules.

- Only include additional logs if explicitly requested in a prompt or task.

- Logs must be **clear and minimal**, avoiding console clutter.

- Remove all debug logs before production deployment.
