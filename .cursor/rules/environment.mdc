globs: **/*.{ts}

- The project must include a dedicated **environment configuration file**, for example: src/environments/environment.ts

- Any value that is **global or environment-dependent** must be defined in this file, such as:
- Base API URL  
- Server IP or domain  
- Global tokens or API keys  
- Timeout or retry configurations  
- Environment flags (`production`, `development`, etc.)

- Example:
```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiBaseUrl: 'https://api.myapp.com',
  serverIp: '127.0.0.1',
};
```
- In code, Cursor must always reference environment variables instead of hardcoding values:
import { environment } from '@environments/environment';
const url = `${environment.apiBaseUrl}/users`;

- Hardcoded values in services or components are not allowed.

- If Cursor detects a repeated or environment-dependent value, it must automatically move it into the environment file.
