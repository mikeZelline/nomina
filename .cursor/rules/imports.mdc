description: Rules for using absolute paths in imports and references
globs: **/*.{ts,html}

- All imports must use **absolute paths**, never relative paths (`../` or `./`).

- The Angular project must be configured to support **path aliases** in `tsconfig.json`, for example:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": "src",
      "paths": {
        "@app/*": ["app/*"],
        "@shared/*": ["app/shared/*"],
        "@core/*": ["app/core/*"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
- Cursor must always prefer absolute imports when creating new files or modifying existing ones.

- This applies to all project entities:
    - Components
    - Services
    - Interfaces
    - Pipes
    - Guards
    - Utility files
    - And any other modules or classes.
